# NumericalMethodsAlgorithms Repository
This repositiory has three folders containing the three different algorithms that I developed in MECH105. The FaslePosition folder
contains code that finds the root or roots of a function using the false position method. The LuFactorization folder gives the user
the lower and upper matrices and pivot matrix of any given square matrix. The Simpson folder has code that sums intervals using the
Simpson's rule and trapezoidal rule depending of number and spacing of intervals.
